I'm not really a creature of the night.

I mean, I _wish_ I was. It's cool. The existence of a vampire and an offbeat creative genius. Both are cool.

But I digress.

In my (formerly) seemingly-sempiternal quest to configure and re-configure my work (and play) habits into an
optimal daily schedule, I've experimented more than a bit, really. (Really?)

So I found I cannot manage to be a night owl for long. According to W. H. Auden, that makes me an honest artist,
not one of the ‘Hitlers of the world’.
