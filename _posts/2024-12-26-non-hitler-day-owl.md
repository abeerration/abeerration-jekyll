Ha!

I've finally configured a routine that works optimally for me.

Yes, it involves being a night-owl. Partially, if you draw a strict distinction
between evening and night.

W. H. Auden was dismissive of night owls: “Only the ‘Hitlers of the world’ work
at night; no honest artist does.”

Why it's "non-Hitler"?

Becaue I finish work at 6 and then go to sleep. Unlike Hitler, who was prowling
outside his bunked at 2 am [1].
